# Oblique Strategies

## An Extremely Simple Golang CLI for Brian Eno's Oblique Strategies

There is not much to this, to be honest. It was written as a fun project to start learning Golang. As a fan of Brian Eno's music, I thought it would be fun to create a randomizer that will output a different, random strategy when run.

For more information on Eno's strategies, go to the [Oblique Strategies Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Strategies).
